 * **howToCloneRepository.md** contains a walkthrough of creating a repository on the unix command line
 
 * **pythonlearn.pdf** is our textbook: *Python for Everybody: Exploring 
Data Using Python 3* by Charles R. Severance
 
 * **syllabusINF308s2019-noEmail.pdf** is the syllabus. Read it. You 
know how they say there is no such thing as a bad question? They're 
wrong. A bad question is when you ask a question and the answer was in 
the syllabus all along. If you have a question, make sure it hasn't 
already been answered. If you ask a question to clarify something 
specific that you found confusing *after* reading the syllabus, that 
is appropriate and encouraged.
