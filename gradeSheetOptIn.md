## Grade Sheet Opt In

If you are concerned with your grade in particular, you may opt-in to have your grades posted in a shared google spreadsheet that displays your grades assigned to an alias. For anonymity, your alias will come from a randomly generated list of animals. If you disclose your alias, this will be the same as disclosing your grades to everyone who knows your alias. If you talk to people about your grades, you may be giving them information that will allow them to figure out which alias is yours. If that happens and you ask for a new alias, people who know your grades may still be able to figure out who you are by reverse engineering from available data (everyone else's aliases will stay the same). Maintaining the privacy of your alias will be your responsibility. You will not receive the link to the shared grade sheet unless you opt in.

If you choose to opt in, add your name to the list below the line. Do not bother opting-in for another student; we can all see whose account was used to make the commit. It will only be considered a valid opt-in if requested from the github account of the person whose name is added.
